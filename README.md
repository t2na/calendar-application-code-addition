# calendar-application-code-addition
A workday calendar for keeping track of daily tasks

Description

The attached project file(s) are for our fifth challenge as part of the UC Berkeley full stack coding bootcamp. The goal of the challenge was to add javascript logic to an existing calendar application. Initially, the calendar application had a few time slots attached to it via HTML, along with a text aria and a save button that included an icon. Some of the tasks we were given included adding additional time slots to the calendar application (above and beyond the three that were included), making it so that whatever text was entered was then saved to the time slot permanently via local storage - e.g. if I entered "feed cat" on the 5pm time slot, it would persist through a page reload - as well as making it so that the time blocks were color coded according to the present time, such that time blocks in the past were colored grey, the present time block was red, and time blocks in the future were green.

This project tested my ability to style a web page using javascript and jQuery, which I used almost exclusively to create many of the page elements. Some of the concepts that were new to me included using jQuery methods for things like creating HTML elements, as well as adding classes to those elements to be used later in callback functions.

Installation
